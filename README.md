# Sensor Network using Graphs

This project is for CSC 401, simulating a wireless sensor network using a graph G = (V, E).\
Progammer: Andres Lara

## Instructions

Once the folder is unzipped, it can be open in an IDE of your choice and executed by running the 'Driver.java' file.\
Alternately, in the terminal, move into the /src directory, then compile and run the 'Driver.java' file using the 'javac' and 'java' commands.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main.java
```

## Examples

In the /screenshots folder, you will find examples for both graph implementations (adjacency list and matrix),\
as well as both methods of traversal (breadth-first and depth-first)
